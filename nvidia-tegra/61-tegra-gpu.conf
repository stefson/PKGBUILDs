# OverlayDepth is a 32-bit integer which is used to control overlay
# stacking order.  The overlay with the lowest depth is in front of
# all others.  This value has meaning only when multiple overlays are
# present on a display.

#    Option      "OverlayDepth" "255"

# ARGBHWCursor controls whether the X driver uses an overlay to
# display 32-bit "true-color" cursors, or whether such cursors are
# emulated in software.  Valid values are "true" to enable hardware
# cursors, and "false" (default) to disable them.
